# Temperature Conversion

This is a simple SwiftUI app that allows users to convert temperatures between three scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The app provides a user-friendly interface to input a temperature value, select the source temperature scale, choose a target scale for conversion, and view the result in real-time.

## Functionality
1. __Temperature Input__: Users can enter a temperature in the TextField, and the input will be automatically validated to ensure that only numeric values are accepted.
2. __Scale Selection__: The user can pick a scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) using a Picker.
3. __Conversion Picker__: The user can select a target scale for conversion, which will trigger the temperature conversion logic.
4. __Real-Time Results__: The converted temperature is displayed as soon as the input and selection are made.
5. __Keyboard Dismiss__: A "Done" button appears when the user starts typing, allowing them to dismiss the keyboard when done.
